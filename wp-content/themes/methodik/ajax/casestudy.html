    <h2>the project</h2>
    <p>John White is a London based business coach who also hosts his own self improvement seminars. We furnished John with a rebrand, new website, and promotional video.</p>

<p>The site incorporates a clean & corporate feel whilst weaving his personality throughout in micro text, and of course, a promotional video. Another requirement of the website was to allow his clients to purchase packages online which we put together in two secure sections.</p>

    <p>I am over the moon with Methodik. Their efforts in redesigning my website went above and beyond my expectations. When it came to shooting my promotional video I couldn't have been in more experienced hands. Methodik were both professional and customer focussed. I would recommend Methodik because of their innovative and methodical approach to solving my challenge, which was my brand identity, web design and video.</p>
